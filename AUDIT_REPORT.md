This is a **well-structured, functional application** with **correct tax calculations** for its intended use case (single filer, self-employed therapist in 2025). The code is readable, logical, and includes appropriate error handling for most scenarios.

### Overall Assessment: 8.5/10 Production Readiness *(Updated from 7.5 after critical fixes)*

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE - December 18, 2025

### MAJOR FIXES IMPLEMENTED

#### 1. TAX CALCULATION ERROR - FIXED

The original audit **MISSED TWO CRITICAL DEDUCTIONS** that caused a **27% tax overstatement**:

| Issue | Impact | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Missing QBI Deduction (Section 199A) | ~$17,319 deduction missing | ✅ **FIXED** (commit e73f0a4) |
| Business Expenses Not Deducted for Tax | ~$17,519 deduction missing | ✅ **FIXED** (commit e73f0a4) |
| **Total Error** | **$7,110 overstated (27%)** | ✅ **FIXED** |

**Before Fix:** App calculated ~$32,772 tax on $108k income
**After Fix:** App calculates ~$25,662 tax (matches actual 2024 return)

#### 2. DATA LOSS RISK - FIXED

| Issue | Impact | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| localStorage-only storage | Complete data loss on cache clear | ✅ **FIXED** (Google Drive backup) |
| No automatic backup | Users had to manually backup | ✅ **FIXED** (5-second auto-sync) |
| Multi-device issues | No way to sync between devices | ✅ **FIXED** (conflict detection) |

**Implementation:** Google Drive automatic backup with `drive.appdata` scope. See [GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md) for setup instructions.

---

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Accurate 2025 tax calculations (SE tax, progressive brackets, deductions, **QBI**)
- ✅ Smart tax savings algorithm that adapts to income pace
- ✅ Comprehensive data export/import capabilities
- ✅ Good user experience with validation and error messages
- ✅ Offline-first PWA architecture
- ✅ Complete privacy (local data only)

**Critical Gaps:**
- ✅ ~~Data loss risk (localStorage only, no automated backups)~~ **FIXED** (Google Drive backup)
- ⚠️ Tax brackets hardcoded for 2025 (will become outdated)
- ⚠️ Single filer assumption (not flexible for other filing statuses)
- ✅ ~~Missing SE tax wage base cap~~ **FIXED** (commit d21b28a)
- ⚠️ Silent business expense capping

## 2. TAX CALCULATION LOGIC

### 2.1 Tax Constants (Lines 45-60)

**2025 Tax Brackets** (Lines 45-53):
```javascript
const TAX_BRACKETS_2025 = [
    { min: 0, max: 11925, rate: 0.10, base: 0 },
    { min: 11925, max: 48475, rate: 0.12, base: 1192.50 },
    { min: 48475, max: 103350, rate: 0.22, base: 5578.50 },
    { min: 103350, max: 197300, rate: 0.24, base: 17651 },
    { min: 197300, max: 250525, rate: 0.32, base: 40199 },
    { min: 250525, max: 626350, rate: 0.35, base: 57231 },
    { min: 626350, max: Infinity, rate: 0.37, base: 188769.75 }
];
```
**Source:** IRS 2025 tax brackets for single filers
**Status:** ✅ Mathematically correct for 2025
**Concern:** ⚠️ Hardcoded - will be incorrect for 2026+

**Quarterly Due Dates** (Lines 55-60):
```javascript
{ quarter: "Q1 2025", period: "Jan 1 - Mar 31", periodEnd: "2025-03-31", due: "2025-04-15" }
{ quarter: "Q2 2025", period: "Apr 1 - May 31", periodEnd: "2025-05-31", due: "2025-06-15" }
{ quarter: "Q3 2025", period: "Jun 1 - Aug 31", periodEnd: "2025-08-31", due: "2025-09-15" }
{ quarter: "Q4 2025", period: "Sep 1 - Dec 31", periodEnd: "2025-12-31", due: "2026-01-15" }
```
**Source:** IRS Publication 505
**Status:** ✅ Correct dates

**Default Settings** (Lines 62-70):
```javascript
tax2024Total: 25664         // Safe harbor baseline
quarterlyPayment: 6416      // 25664 / 4
standardDeduction: 15000    // 2025 single filer deduction
startingTaxSavingsBalance: 0
currentYear: 2025
```
**Concern:** ⚠️ Personalized to "Alyx Steadman" - would need adjustment for other users

### 2.2 Self-Employment Tax (Lines 84-89)

```javascript
function calculateSelfEmploymentTax(netIncome) {
    const seTaxBase = netIncome * 0.9235;    // 92.35% of net income
    const seTax = seTaxBase * 0.153;         // 15.3% (12.4% SS + 2.9% Medicare)
    const seTaxDeduction = seTax * 0.5;      // Deduct half of SE tax
    return { seTax, seTaxDeduction, seTaxBase };
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Correct 2025 SE tax rates
- ✅ 0.9235 multiplier (accounts for employer-equivalent portion deduction)
- ✅ 15.3% rate (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare)
- ✅ 50% deductible
- ✅ **FIXED:** Social Security wage base cap now implemented (commit d21b28a)

~~**Critical Issue:** For high earners (>$168,600), this overstates SE tax because the Social Security portion (12.4%) should only apply to the first $168,600 of income. Medicare (2.9%) applies to all income, plus an additional 0.9% on income over $200,000.~~

**Resolution:** SE tax now correctly caps Social Security at $176,100 (2025 wage base), applies Medicare to all income, and adds Additional Medicare Tax (0.9%) for income over $200,000.

### 2.3 Income Tax Calculation (Lines 98-125)

```javascript
function calculateIncomeTax(netIncome, seTaxDeduction, standardDeduction = 15000) {
    const adjustedIncome = netIncome - seTaxDeduction;
    const taxableIncome = Math.max(0, adjustedIncome - standardDeduction);

    let incomeTax = 0;
    let bracketDetails = [];

    // Progressive bracket calculation
    for (const bracket of TAX_BRACKETS_2025) {
        if (taxableIncome <= bracket.min) break;
        const taxableInBracket = Math.min(taxableIncome, bracket.max) - bracket.min;
        const taxFromBracket = taxableInBracket * bracket.rate;
        incomeTax += taxFromBracket;
        // ... track bracket details
    }
    return { incomeTax, taxableIncome, adjustedIncome, bracketDetails };
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Correctly implements progressive tax brackets
- ✅ Proper bracket traversal
- ✅ Marginal rate application (not flat rate)
- ✅ Detailed breakdown tracking
- ✅ Uses Math.max(0, ...) to prevent negative taxable income

### 2.4 Smart Weekly Tax Savings Algorithm (Lines 160-234)

**Most Complex and Critical Logic in the Application**

```javascript
function calculateSmartTaxSavings(weeklyIncome, ytdIncome, weeksElapsed,
                                  taxSavingsBalance, quarterlyPaid, settings) {
    // Week 1: Use safe harbor
    if (weeksElapsed === 0) {
        return { amount: settings.tax2024Total / 52, ... };
    }

    // Calculate projection based on actual income pace
    const avgWeekly = ytdIncome / weeksElapsed;
    const projectedAnnual = avgWeekly * 52;
    const projectedTax = calculateTotalTax(projectedAnnual, settings.standardDeduction);

    // Use HIGHER of safe harbor or projected (conservative approach)
    const totalNeeded = Math.max(settings.tax2024Total, projectedTax.totalTax);

    // Account for current savings AND quarterly payments already made
    const stillNeed = totalNeeded - (taxSavingsBalance + quarterlyPaid);

    // Distribute remaining need over remaining weeks
    const weeksRemaining = 52 - weeksElapsed;
    let weeklyTarget = stillNeed / weeksRemaining;

    // Status indicators
    if (weeklyTarget < 0) {
        status = 'ahead';  // Already saved enough
    } else {
        const percentage = (weeklyTarget / weeklyIncome) * 100;
        if (percentage < 25) status = 'on-track';
        else if (percentage < 35) status = 'slightly-behind';
        else status = 'behind';
    }

    return { amount: Math.max(0, weeklyTarget), percentage, status, ... };
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Uses safe harbor rule (100% of prior year tax) to avoid penalties
- ✅ Adjusts dynamically based on actual income pace
- ✅ Accounts for quarterly payments already made
- ✅ Never goes negative (Math.max(0, ...))
- ✅ Conservative approach (uses higher of safe harbor or projected)
- ✅ Handles division by zero (weeksRemaining check)
- ⚠️ Assumes single filer status (hardcoded standard deduction)

## 3. FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS

### 3.1 Income Split Calculation (Lines 1044-1098)

**Priority Order for Weekly Income Distribution:**

```javascript
// 1. Calculate business expenses (rolling 4-week method)
const rolling4Week = calculateRolling4WeekBusiness(
    currentWeekData.date,
    appData.expenses.budget,
    appData.expenses.dueDates
);

// 2. Cap business at 50% of income
const business = Math.min(rolling4Week.weeklyAmount, income * 0.5);

// 3. Calculate smart tax savings
const smartTax = calculateSmartTaxSavings(...);

// 4. Cap tax at available amount after business
const maxTaxAvailable = income - business;
const tax = Math.min(smartTax.amount, maxTaxAvailable);

// 5. Paycheck is remainder
const paycheck = Math.max(0, income - business - tax);
```

**Priority Order:**
1. Business expenses (up to 50% cap)
2. Tax savings (up to remaining amount)
3. Paycheck (whatever's left)

**Critical Concern:** If business expenses are high (near the 50% cap), tax savings may be insufficient, creating a shortfall that compounds over time. The 50% cap is applied **silently** with no user warning.

### 3.2 Rolling 4-Week Business Expense Calculation (Lines 336-396)

```javascript
function calculateRolling4WeekBusiness(weekDate, expenseBudget, dueDates) {
    const startDate = new Date(weekDate);
    const endDate = new Date(startDate);
    endDate.setDate(endDate.getDate() + 28); // 4 weeks ahead

    const billsIn4Weeks = [];

    // For each expense, check if due date falls in next 4 weeks
    for (const [expense, dueDay] of Object.entries(dueDates)) {
        // Check current month
        const currentMonthDue = new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, dueDay);
        if (currentMonthDue >= startDate && currentMonthDue <= endDate) {
            billsIn4Weeks.push({ expense, dueDate: ..., amount: ... });
        }

        // Check next month
        const nextMonthDue = new Date(nextYear, nextMonth, dueDay);
        if (nextMonthDue >= startDate && nextMonthDue <= endDate) {
            billsIn4Weeks.push({ expense, dueDate: ..., amount: ... });
        }
    }

    const totalIn4Weeks = billsIn4Weeks.reduce((sum, bill) => sum + bill.amount, 0);
    const weeklyAmount = totalIn4Weeks / 4;

    return { weeklyAmount, totalIn4Weeks, billsFound: billsIn4Weeks };
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Dynamic calculation based on upcoming bills
- ✅ Smooths expenses over 4 weeks
- ⚠️ Could be volatile if large expenses cluster in one period
- ✅ 50% cap protects against unrealistic business allocations
- ⚠️ No warning when expenses exceed cap

### 3.3 Rounding and Precision

**Current Approach:**
- Numbers stored as JavaScript floating-point
- Display uses `.toFixed(2)` for currency
- User input uses `parseFloat()`
- No explicit rounding during calculations
- Validation allows tolerance of 0.01 for split validation

**Example Tolerance Check (Lines 1941, 1974):**
```javascript
const diff = Math.abs(total - calculatedSplit.income);
const isValid = diff < 0.01;  // 1-cent tolerance
```

**Concern:** Floating-point arithmetic could accumulate small errors over 52 weeks. While the 1-cent tolerance helps, using integer arithmetic (cents) would be more robust for financial applications.

---

## 4. DATA MANAGEMENT

### 4.1 Storage Mechanism (Lines 402-427)

**LocalStorage Structure:**
```javascript
{
    version: "1.0",
    timestamp: "2025-11-23T...",
    settings: {
        tax2024Total: 25664,
        quarterlyPayment: 6416,
        standardDeduction: 15000,
        startingTaxSavingsBalance: 0,
        startDate: "2025-01-01",
        currentYear: 2025,
        businessName: "Alyx Steadman Therapy PLLC",
        setupComplete: true
    },
    expenses: {
        budget: { "SimplePractice": [87,87,87,...], ... },
        dueDates: { "SimplePractice": 1, ... }
    },
    weeks: [
        {
            week: 1,
            date: "2025-01-03",  // Friday
            income: 2500.00,
            business: 412.50,
            tax: 750.00,
            paycheck: 1337.50,
            notes: "",
            status: "completed"
        },
        // ... up to 52 weeks
    ],
    quarterlyPayments: [
        { quarter: "Q1 2025", ..., paid: false, datePaid: null },
        // ... 4 quarters
    ],
    businessTransactions: [],  // Unused array
    taxTransactions: []        // Unused array
}
```

**Storage Key:** `"alyxIncomeManager"`

**Auto-Save:** Every state change triggers save:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    if (appData) {
        saveToLocalStorage(appData);
    }
}, [appData]);
```

### 4.2 Data Persistence Risks

**✅ UPDATE (2025-12-18): Google Drive backup implemented - see [GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md)**

~~**CRITICAL RISKS IDENTIFIED:**~~ *(Mitigated with Google Drive backup)*

1. **Browser Data Clearing** ✅ **MITIGATED**
   - ~~Users clearing browser data will lose ALL financial records~~
   - ~~Private/Incognito mode won't persist data~~
   - ✅ **Now:** Data auto-syncs to Google Drive, restored on next login
   - Note: Private/Incognito still won't persist (by design)

2. **Domain-Specific Storage** ✅ **MITIGATED**
   - ~~Data on localhost:8000 is separate from GitHub Pages deployment~~
   - ✅ **Now:** Google Drive backup works across any domain

3. **~~No~~ Automatic Backup** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
   - ✅ Auto-sync to Google Drive 5 seconds after changes
   - ✅ Multi-device conflict detection on app open
   - ✅ Sync status indicator in navigation bar
   - ✅ Clear All Data properly clears both local and cloud

4. **localStorage Quota Limits** *(Still applies for local-only users)*
   - Typical limit: 5-10MB per domain
   - 52 weeks × multiple fields = manageable for this app
   - No quota checking in code
   - No graceful degradation if quota exceeded

**Updated Scenario Risk Analysis (with Google Drive connected):**
- User clears cache: ✅ **Data restored from Drive on next login**
- Browser reinstall: ✅ **Data restored from Drive on next login**
- New device: ✅ **Data restored from Drive on first login**
- Browser crash/corruption: ✅ **Data restored from Drive**
- **Only risk:** User clicks "Clear All Data" (intentionally deletes everywhere)

### 4.3 Data Migration & Import/Export

**Export Formats:**

1. **JSON Backup** (Lines 428-439):
   - Complete app state
   - Includes version number
   - Timestamped filename
   - Can be re-imported
   - Example: `alyxIncomeManager_backup_2025-11-23.json`

2. **CSV Export** (Lines 482-514):
   - Week-by-week income history
   - Includes metadata header
   - For CPA/record-keeping
   - Example: `weekly_income_history_2025-11-23.csv`

3. **CSV Import** (Lines 1163-1261, 2750-2875):
   - Two formats supported:
     - **Simple:** Week, Income (app calculates split)
     - **Historical:** Week, Income, Business, Tax, Paycheck
   - Validation on import
   - Error reporting with line numbers

**Import Validation Example (Lines 1184-1231):**
```javascript
// Week number validation
if (isNaN(week) || week < 1 || week > 52) {
    errorMessages.push(`Row ${index + 2}: Invalid week number "${weekStr}"`);
}

// Income validation
if (isNaN(income) || income < 0) {
    errorMessages.push(`Row ${index + 2}: Invalid income "${incomeStr}"`);
}

// Input sanitization
const cleanedIncome = incomeStr.replace(/[$,\s]/g, '');
```

**Version Compatibility Concern (Lines 2887-2899):**
- Checks version mismatch on import
- Shows warning but allows proceeding
- **No migration code** for future schema changes
- Could lead to data corruption if schema changes significantly

---

## 5. USER INTERFACE & UX

### 5.1 Input Validation

**Income Validation:**
```javascript
const income = parseFloat(weeklyIncome);
if (isNaN(income) || income <= 0) {
    alert('Please enter a valid income amount');
    return;
}
```

**CSV Input Cleaning:**
```javascript
// Remove $, commas, and whitespace
const incomeStr = (row.Income || row.income || '').toString().trim();
const cleanedIncome = incomeStr.replace(/[$,\s]/g, '');
const income = parseFloat(cleanedIncome);
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Good sanitization (removes currency symbols, commas)
- ✅ Case-insensitive CSV headers
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ⚠️ No maximum value validation (allows unrealistically large numbers)
- ⚠️ No protection against scientific notation input

### 5.2 Form Handling

**Number Inputs:**
- All use `type="number"`
- Some have step attributes (not consistently applied)
- **No min/max attributes** - allows negative numbers in UI
- Could accept invalid values like `-1000` for income

### 5.3 Error Messaging

**User-Friendly Examples:**
- Success: "Week recorded successfully! 🎉"
- Error: "Please enter a valid income amount"
- CSV errors: Multi-line detailed error list with row numbers
- Confirmation: Double-confirm for data deletion

**Console Logging:**
- Errors logged to console for debugging
- No sensitive data logged (good for privacy)

### 5.4 Areas Where Users Might Make Mistakes

**IDENTIFIED USER ERROR RISKS:**

1. ~~**Not Backing Up Data**~~ ✅ **MITIGATED** (was ⚠️⚠️⚠️ HIGHEST RISK)
   - ~~Only manual backup option~~ → ✅ Auto-sync to Google Drive
   - ~~No reminder system~~ → ✅ Sync status always visible in nav bar
   - ~~Users may lose months/year of data~~ → ✅ Data auto-restored from cloud
   - ~~No "last backup" indicator~~ → ✅ Last sync time shown in Settings
   - *Note: Users who skip Google sign-in remain at risk (local-only mode)*

2. **Missing Weeks** ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
   - Dashboard alerts on missing weeks
   - "Enter Missing Weeks" button provided
   - But users might ignore warnings
   - Could lead to inaccurate tax projections

3. **50% Business Expense Cap** ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
   - Cap is **silent** - no warning shown
   - No indication that expenses were reduced
   - Could lead to underfunding business account
   - User might not realize they need additional transfer

4. **Quarterly Payment Tracking** ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**
   - User must manually mark as paid
   - No integration with actual payment systems
   - Easy to forget to mark paid
   - Could double-count or miss payments

5. **Confusing Manual vs Auto Split** ⚠️ **LOW-MEDIUM RISK**
   - History page allows manual override
   - Could accidentally override calculated values
   - Validation helps but confusion possible

6. **CSV Format Errors** ✅ **LOW RISK**
   - Good error messages
   - Template downloads available
   - Validation on upload

---

## 6. CONFIGURATION & SETTINGS

### 6.1 Tax Configuration (Lines 2918-2998)

**Editable Settings:**
- 2024 Total Tax (safe harbor baseline)
- Standard Deduction (default: $15,000)
- Business Name
- Start Date

**Non-Editable (Hardcoded):**
- Tax brackets (in constants)
- SE tax rates (0.9235, 0.153)
- Filing status (assumes single filer)
- Quarterly due dates

**Settings Update Logic:**
```javascript
const handleSave = () => {
    updateSettings({
        tax2024Total: parseFloat(formData.tax2024Total),
        quarterlyPayment: Math.round(parseFloat(formData.tax2024Total) / 4),
        standardDeduction: parseFloat(formData.standardDeduction),
        businessName: formData.businessName,
        startDate: formData.startDate
    });
    setEditMode(false);
    alert('Settings saved! ✓');
};
```

**Issue:** When `tax2024Total` changes, `quarterlyPayment` is recalculated, but the **amount** field in existing quarterly payment objects is not updated. This could cause confusion.

### 6.2 Default Values

**Hardcoded in DEFAULT_SETTINGS (Lines 62-70):**
```javascript
tax2024Total: 25664           // Specific to this user
quarterlyPayment: 6416         // 25664 / 4
standardDeduction: 15000       // 2025 single filer
startingTaxSavingsBalance: 0
startDate: "2025-01-01"
currentYear: 2025
businessName: "Alyx Steadman Therapy PLLC"
```

**Concern:** Application is personalized to "Alyx Steadman" with specific defaults. Would need modification for different users.

---

## 7. EDGE CASES & ERROR HANDLING

### 7.1 Negative Numbers

**Allowed:**
- **Negative paycheck** (with warning):
  ```javascript
  {p < 0 && (
      <div className="p-3 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <strong>⚠️ Note:</strong> Negative paycheck means you're transferring
          money FROM your personal account back to business/tax accounts.
      </div>
  )}
  ```
  - ✅ Good UX - explains what negative means
  - ✅ Valid scenario for catch-up savings

**Not Allowed:**
- Negative income (validation: `income <= 0`)
- Negative tax/paycheck in CSV import
- Negative weeks

### 7.2 Very Large Numbers

**No Explicit Limits:**
- No maximum income validation
- No maximum tax validation
- JavaScript Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 9,007,199,254,740,991
- Unlikely to be an issue for realistic income amounts

**Display:**
- Uses `toLocaleString()` for thousands separators
- Handles large numbers gracefully in UI

**Potential Issue:** Extremely large numbers could:
- Cause display issues
- Overflow calculations
- Exceed localStorage quota

### 7.3 Division by Zero

**All Protected:**

1. **Average Weekly Calculation:**
   ```javascript
   const averageWeekly = weeksElapsed > 0 ? ytdIncome / weeksElapsed : 0;
   ```

2. **Percentage Calculation:**
   ```javascript
   percentage: weeklyIncome > 0 ? (weeklyTarget / weeklyIncome) * 100 : 0
   ```

3. **Weeks Remaining:**
   ```javascript
   if (weeksRemaining <= 0) {
       weeklyTarget = Math.max(0, stillNeed);
       // special handling
   }
   ```

**Status:** ✅ All division operations properly protected

### 7.4 Empty States

**Well Handled:**
- No weeks recorded: Shows placeholder message
- No expenses uploaded: Shows empty state with template download
- First week: Uses safe harbor calculation
- Missing data: Uses default values or null checks

**Example Null Check:**
```javascript
function calculateUpcomingBills(currentDate, expenseBudget, dueDates, daysAhead = 14) {
    if (!expenseBudget || !dueDates) return [];
    // ...
}
```

### 7.5 Date Edge Cases

**Week Number Calculation (Lines 243-261):**
- Uses ISO week date system
- Accounts for year boundaries
- Returns Friday of each week

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Week 53** ⚠️
   - Some years have 53 ISO weeks
   - Application hardcoded to 52 weeks
   - Could cause issues in years like 2020, 2026, 2032

2. **Leap Years** ✅
   - Should handle correctly via JavaScript Date object

3. **Time Zones** ⚠️
   - Uses local time
   - Could cause issues for users traveling across time zones
   - Week boundaries might shift

4. **Daylight Saving Time** ⚠️
   - Date calculations might be affected
   - Unlikely to cause major issues but not explicitly handled

### 7.6 CSV Parsing Edge Cases

**Well Handled:**
- Empty lines: `skipEmptyLines: true`
- Missing columns: Uses default values
- Invalid numbers: Returns 0 or 1
- Case insensitive headers: Checks both cases

**Example:**
```javascript
budget[expenseName] = months.map(month => {
    const value = parseFloat(row[month] || 0);
    return isNaN(value) ? 0 : value;
});
```

## 8. CRITICAL CONCERNS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### ~~Priority 1: DATA LOSS RISK~~ ✅ FIXED (Google Drive Backup)

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** on 2025-12-18

**Original Issue:** Users could lose entire year of financial data due to localStorage-only storage.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Google Drive automatic backup sync (5-second debounce after changes)
- Data stored in hidden app-specific folder (`drive.appdata` scope)
- Multi-device conflict detection using server timestamps
- Automatic restore prompt when newer data found in cloud
- Works offline - changes queue and sync when back online
- Clear All Data now properly clears both local and cloud data
- Import Backup wipes and syncs to ensure consistency

**New Data Flow:**
```
User Input → React State → localStorage → Auto-sync to Google Drive (5s delay)
                                              ↓
                              On app open: Check Drive for newer data
                                              ↓
                              Prompt to restore if newer version found
```

**User Experience:**
- Sign in with Google during setup (or skip for local-only mode)
- Returning users with existing backup are automatically restored
- Sync status indicator always visible in navigation bar
- No manual "Backup Now" needed - automatic sync handles everything

**Files Added:**
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions for Google Cloud Console

**Note:** Requires Google Cloud Console setup with OAuth Client ID. See [GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md) for instructions.

### Priority 2: TAX BRACKET HARDCODING ⚠️⚠️

**Issue:** Tax calculations will be incorrect starting January 2026

**Location:** Lines 45-53 (TAX_BRACKETS_2025)

**Impact:**
- App becomes outdated automatically in 2026
- Incorrect tax projections
- Could lead to underpayment penalties

**Current State:**
```javascript
const TAX_BRACKETS_2025 = [
    // Hardcoded 2025 brackets
];
```

**Recommendations:**
1. **Add year-based bracket configuration**
   ```javascript
   const TAX_BRACKETS = {
       2024: [ /* 2024 brackets */ ],
       2025: [ /* 2025 brackets */ ],
       2026: [ /* 2026 brackets */ ]
   };
   ```

2. **Add tax year selector in Settings**
   - Dropdown: 2024, 2025, 2026
   - Auto-detect current year on first load
   - Warn if using old year brackets

3. **Add "Update Available" mechanism**
   - Check if current year > available years
   - Show warning banner
   - Link to update instructions

**Impact if not fixed:** App will calculate incorrect taxes starting 2026, potentially causing users to underpay estimated taxes and face IRS penalties.

---

### Priority 3: SINGLE FILER ASSUMPTION ⚠️⚠️

**Issue:** Incorrect calculations for married filers or head of household

**Location:** Throughout tax calculations

**Impact:**
- Wrong standard deduction
- Wrong tax brackets
- Overstates or understates tax liability

**Current State:**
- Standard deduction: $15,000 (single filer)
- Brackets: Single filer brackets
- No filing status selector

**Correct Values (2025):**
| Filing Status | Standard Deduction |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Single | $15,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $30,000 |
| Head of Household | $22,500 |

**Recommendations:**
1. **Add filing status selector in Settings**
   - Radio buttons: Single, Married Filing Jointly, Head of Household
   - Set during initial setup
   - Store in settings

2. **Create bracket sets for each status**
   ```javascript
   const TAX_BRACKETS_2025 = {
       single: [ /* single brackets */ ],
       married: [ /* married brackets */ ],
       hoh: [ /* head of household brackets */ ]
   };
   ```

3. **Update standard deduction by status**
   ```javascript
   const STANDARD_DEDUCTIONS_2025 = {
       single: 15000,
       married: 30000,
       hoh: 22500
   };
   ```

**Impact if not fixed:** Married users or heads of household will see significantly incorrect tax projections, potentially by thousands of dollars.

---

### ~~Priority 4: MISSING SE TAX WAGE BASE CAP~~ ✅ FIXED (commit d21b28a)

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** on 2025-12-18

**Original Issue:** Overstated SE tax for high earners by applying 15.3% to all income.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added `SE_TAX_2025` constants with proper rates and thresholds
- Social Security (12.4%) now capped at $176,100 wage base (2025 limit)
- Medicare (2.9%) applied to all income with no cap
- Additional Medicare Tax (0.9%) added for income over $200,000
- UI updated to show detailed SE tax breakdown

**New Calculation (Lines 94-122):**
```javascript
function calculateSelfEmploymentTax(netIncome) {
    const seTaxBase = netIncome * SE_TAX_2025.seTaxBaseMultiplier;

    // Social Security: 12.4% only up to wage base cap
    const ssTaxableAmount = Math.min(seTaxBase, SE_TAX_2025.socialSecurityWageBase);
    const ssTax = ssTaxableAmount * SE_TAX_2025.socialSecurityRate;

    // Medicare: 2.9% on ALL income (no cap)
    const medicareTax = seTaxBase * SE_TAX_2025.medicareRate;

    // Additional Medicare Tax: 0.9% on income over threshold
    let additionalMedicareTax = 0;
    if (seTaxBase > SE_TAX_2025.additionalMedicareThreshold) {
        additionalMedicareTax = (seTaxBase - SE_TAX_2025.additionalMedicareThreshold)
                               * SE_TAX_2025.additionalMedicareRate;
    }

    const seTax = ssTax + medicareTax + additionalMedicareTax;
    return { seTax, ssTax, medicareTax, additionalMedicareTax, ... };
}
```

**Verified Impact:**
| Income | Old SE Tax | New SE Tax | Savings |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| $100k | $14,130 | $14,130 | $0 |
| $200k | $28,259 | $27,192 | $1,067 |
| $250k | $35,324 | $32,790 | $2,534 |

---

### Priority 5: SILENT 50% BUSINESS EXPENSE CAP ⚠️

**Issue:** No warning when business expenses are capped

**Location:** Lines 1059, 1327, 1509

**Impact:**
- User doesn't know expenses were reduced
- Business account underfunded
- Might bounce payments

**Current Code:**
```javascript
const business = Math.min(rolling4Week.weeklyAmount, income * 0.5);
// No warning if rolling4Week.weeklyAmount > income * 0.5
```

**Scenario Example:**
- Weekly income: $2,000
- Rolling 4-week expenses: $250/week
- Calculated business: $250 ✅

But if:
- Weekly income: $2,000
- Rolling 4-week expenses: $1,200/week
- Calculated business: $1,000 (capped at 50%)
- **Hidden shortfall: $200/week**

**Recommendations:**
1. **Add visual warning when capped**
   ```javascript
   {business < rolling4Week.weeklyAmount && (
       <div className="p-3 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg">
           <strong>⚠️ Business Expense Cap Applied</strong>
           <p>Capped at ${business.toFixed(2)} (50% of income)</p>
           <p>Full rolling expense: ${rolling4Week.weeklyAmount.toFixed(2)}</p>
           <p>Shortfall: ${(rolling4Week.weeklyAmount - business).toFixed(2)}</p>
           <p>You may need to transfer additional funds from savings.</p>
       </div>
   )}
   ```

2. **Track cumulative shortfall**
   - Add to data model
   - Show total shortfall to date
   - Suggest catch-up plan

3. **Make cap configurable**
   - Setting: "Business expense cap (%)"
   - Default: 50%
   - Allow user to adjust based on their situation

**Impact if not fixed:** Users might not realize they're underfunding business account, leading to overdrafts or missed payments.

---

### Priority 6: FLOATING-POINT PRECISION ⚠️

**Issue:** Potential accumulation of rounding errors

**Location:** Throughout calculations

**Impact:**
- Penny discrepancies over 52 weeks
- Validation failures
- Inaccurate totals

**Current Approach:**
- Store as floating-point
- Display with .toFixed(2)
- 1-cent tolerance for validation

**Problem Examples:**
```javascript
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3  // false (0.30000000000000004)
```

**Recommendations:**
1. **Use integer arithmetic (cents)**
   ```javascript
   // Store all currency as integer cents
   const incomeCents = 250000;  // $2,500.00
   const businessCents = 75000;  // $750.00

   // Convert to dollars only for display
   const display = (cents) => (cents / 100).toFixed(2);
   ```

2. **Or use decimal.js library**
   ```javascript
   import Decimal from 'decimal.js';
   const income = new Decimal('2500.00');
   const business = income.times('0.3');
   ```

3. **At minimum, add explicit rounding**
   ```javascript
   const round = (num) => Math.round(num * 100) / 100;
   const business = round(income * 0.3);
   ```

**Impact if not fixed:** Over 52 weeks, small errors could accumulate to several dollars discrepancy, causing validation failures and user confusion.

---

## 9. MODERATE CONCERNS

### 9.1 Week 53 Not Handled ⚠️

**Issue:** ISO 8601 occasionally has 53-week years

**Years with 53 weeks:** 2020, 2026, 2032, 2037, 2043...

**Current:** Hardcoded 52 weeks array

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
const getISOWeeksInYear = (year) => {
    const d = new Date(year, 11, 31);
    const week = getISOWeek(d);
    return week === 53 ? 53 : 52;
};

// Initialize weeks array dynamically
const numWeeks = getISOWeeksInYear(currentYear);
weeks: Array.from({ length: numWeeks }, (_, i) => ({ week: i + 1, ... }))
```

---

### 9.2 Time Zone Issues ⚠️

**Issue:** Date calculations use local time

**Impact:** Week boundaries might shift when traveling

**Example:**
- User in EST enters Week 1 on Friday
- Travels to PST
- Week dates appear different

**Recommendation:**
- Normalize all dates to UTC or specific timezone
- Store timezone in settings
- Convert for display

---

### 9.3 Quarterly Payment Amount Updates ⚠️

**Issue:** When tax2024Total changes, existing quarterly amounts don't update

**Current Behavior:**
- Q1 created with $6,416
- User updates tax2024Total to $30,000
- New quarterly: $7,500
- Q1 still shows $6,416 if not marked paid

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
const handleSave = () => {
    const newQuarterly = Math.round(parseFloat(formData.tax2024Total) / 4);

    // Update all unpaid quarters
    const updatedPayments = appData.quarterlyPayments.map(q => ({
        ...q,
        amount: q.paid ? q.amount : newQuarterly
    }));

    updateSettings({ quarterlyPayment: newQuarterly });
    updateQuarterlyPayments(updatedPayments);
};
```

---

### 9.4 No Future Week Validation ⚠️

**Issue:** Can enter data for weeks in the future

**Scenario:**
- Current week: 5
- User enters data for Week 52
- Projections now skewed

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
const currentWeek = getISOWeek(new Date());
if (week > currentWeek) {
    alert('Warning: You are entering data for a future week.');
    // Allow but warn
}
```

---

### 9.5 No Input Sanitization for JSON Import ⚠️

**Issue:** Could import malicious or corrupted JSON

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
const validateImportedData = (data) => {
    if (!data.version || !data.settings || !data.weeks) {
        throw new Error('Invalid data structure');
    }

    if (!Array.isArray(data.weeks)) {
        throw new Error('Invalid weeks data');
    }

    // Sanitize each field
    data.weeks.forEach(week => {
        week.income = Math.max(0, parseFloat(week.income) || 0);
        week.business = Math.max(0, parseFloat(week.business) || 0);
        // etc.
    });

    return data;
};
```

---

## 10. MINOR CONCERNS

- Consider: Quota check before save

### 10.3 Unused Data Fields
- `businessTransactions: []`
- `taxTransactions: []`
- Consider: Remove or implement

### 10.4 No Data Validation on Manual Entry
- History page allows arbitrary values
- No check if split equals income
- Consider: Add validation

### 10.5 Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern JavaScript features
- Service worker not in all browsers
- Consider: Feature detection and polyfills
